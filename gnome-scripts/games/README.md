# Installing League of Legends
### Install the launcher titled Standard version for your region in lutris client
- There are two downloads one after the other: the initial client download and the Riot client download. Wait for both downloads to finish.
- Do not enter your login details and login or click play. Instead, just quit the launcher when the two downloads have finished.

# Optimising League of Legends
1. Enable low spec mode in league client
2. Change in-game video settings:
    - **Window mode** - borderless
    - **Graphics** - most intense settings that should be reduced first are Shadow Quality and Environment Quality
    - **Character Inking** - false
    - **Frame Rate Cap** - If you have a powerful machine set this to double your monitors refresh rate (eg. 60hz monitor == 120 FPS cap), this is a decent middle ground between curbing wasted CPU cycles and not giving up too many input frames
    - **Anti-Aliasing** - False
    - **Wait for Vertical Sync** - False
